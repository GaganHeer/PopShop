<h1 class="heading">About Dr. Browns</h1>
	<p><span class="rightborder"><img src="images/browns1.jpg"></span></p>

	<p>Dr. Brown's was created in 1869 and was commonly sold in New York delicatessens and by soda salesmen who
	sold the product from door to door in Jewish neighborhoods.</p>
	
	<p><span class="leftborder"><img src="images/browns2.jpg"></span></p>
	
	<p>According to former marketing director, Harry Gold, a New York doctor used celery seeds and sugar to 
	invent the cream soda and celery tonic now known as Cel-Ray, which was advertised as a "pure beverage for the nerves."</p>
	
	<p>In the early 1930s, before Coca-Cola received kosher certification, many Jewish people drank Cel-Ray soda as well 
	as the other flavored soda that had been created by Dr. Brown.</p>
	
	<p>In the last 25 years, the cans were redesigned by Herb Lubalin.</p>
	
	<p>Each of the six Dr. Brown's flavors is packaged with a New York vignette taken from old prints, to emphasize the 
	brand's origins in 1800s New York.</p>
