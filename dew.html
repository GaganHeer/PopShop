<h1 class="heading">About Mountain Dew</h1>
	<p><span class="rightborder"><img src="images/dew1.jpg"></span></p>
	
	<p>Mountain Dew was first created in Virginia in 1948. It was bottled and sold by the Minges family.</p> 
	
	<p>It is known as a soft drink, but Mountain Dew differs slightly from many of the other carbonated 
	drinks because it contains real orange juice.</p>
	
	<p>In 1973, the Pepsi-Cola Company, which now owned Mountain Dew, decided on a change. They wanted 
	to target a younger audience. </p>
	
	<p><span class="leftborder"><img src="images/dew2.jpg"></span></p>
	
	<p>By 1993, the new slogan was “Do the Dew.” The word “mountain” was almost completely forgotten.</p>
	
	<p>Then in 1995, Mountain Dew sponsored the first X Games, celebrating extreme sports. Commercials at 
	that time showed young people skateboarding through traffic and grabbing unprotected bottles of Mountain
	Dew, or athletes running down a cheetah to retrieve a stolen can of the drink from the animal’s throat</p>
	
	<p>It is now one of the most popular soft drinks made and also continues to sponsor the annual Dew Action 
	Extreme Sports Tour and the summer and winter X Games.</p>
