<h1 class="heading">About Jones Soda</h1>
	<p><span class="rightborder"><img src="images/jones1.png"></span></p>
	
	<p>Created in Vancouver, BC in 1995 from the vision of Jones Soda founder, Peter van Stolk, 
	and photographer/designer Victor John Penner</p>	
	
	<p>Jones was launched with the idea of incorporating random photographs onto their bottles 
	using shots taken by Penner. </p>
	
	<p><span class="leftborder"><img src="images/jones2.jpg"></span></p>
	
	<p>But when consumers began submitting their own photos, they quickly realized that user 
	sourced participation made the brand even more special. It wasn't the Jones brand anymore. 
	It was the fans brand!</p>
	
	<p>Don't forget about their caps! Fans love the quotes they find under Jones Soda caps, which offer pearls 
	of wisdom, advice, or simple daily pick me ups.</p> 
	<p>Collected and shared through social media, Jones Soda caps have become nearly as synonymous 
	with their brand as the photos, and are part of what makes them who they are.</p>
